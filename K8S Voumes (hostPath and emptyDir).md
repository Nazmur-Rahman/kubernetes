## Kubernetes Volume

In **Kubernetes**, a **volume** is a storage unit that a Pod can use.  
Unlike containers (which are temporary and get deleted when restarted), **volumes let data persist** across container restarts or be shared between multiple containers in the same Pod.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Kubernetes Volumes

#### 1. EmptyDir
- Created when a Pod starts, deleted when the Pod stops.  
- Useful for temporary scratch space or caching.  

**Example (YAML):**


   <img width="199" height="78" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddb1d632-7e22-45ee-b992-0ba6bae874e6" />


---

#### 2. HostPath
- Mounts a file or directory from the Nodeâ€™s filesystem into the Pod.  
- Good for testing, but risky in production since it ties Pod to a node.  

**Example (YAML):**


   <img width="203" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9d434ea-01a6-4a15-b4b5-9f2edc9f0583" />


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task 1: Creating POD with hostPath
Create a file named mydep-hp.yaml using the content given below
```
vi mypod-hp.yaml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod-hp
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: myvol
   hostPath:
    path: /data
 containers:
  - image: nginx:latest
    name: con1
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: myvol
      mountPath: /app
  ```
Save and exit the editor and Apply the Deployment yaml created in the previous step
```
kubectl apply -f mypod-hp.yaml
```
View the objects created by Kubernetes and verify hostPath mounting in POD
```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
From the above take a note on which pods are running on which particular node, as this would be required in the below steps.
```
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
Access shell on a container running in your Pod to verify volume
```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
```
```
cd /app
```
```
echo "Welcome to DevOps Training" > index.html
```
```
exit
```
Now delete your pod
```
kubectl delete -f mypod-hp.yaml --force
```
Now ssh into the Node on which the particular pod( in which you went inside and created the index.html file) was running.
```
ssh ubuntu@<External-IP>
```
Navigate to the Source location. In this case /data
```
cd /data
```
```
ls -la
```
You would see the index.html file still existing
```
cat index.html
```
```
exit
```


## Task 2 : Creating Deployment with emptyDir
Create a file named mydep-empty.yaml using content given below
```
vi mydep-empty.yaml
```
Paste the following content into the file:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mydep-empty
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mydep
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mydep
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        name: con1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: empty-vol
          mountPath: /data
      - image: tomcat:latest
        name: con2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: empty-vol
          mountPath: /opt/data
      volumes:
      - name: empty-vol
        emptyDir: {}
  ```
Save and exit the editor
Apply the Deployment yaml created in the previous step
```
kubectl apply -f mydep-empty.yaml
```
View the objects created by Kubernetes Deployment and verify hostPath mounting in POD
```
kubectl get deployments
```
```
kubectl get pods
```
```
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
Access shell on a container running in your Pod to verify volume
```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <ctr-name> -- /bin/bash
```
```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <ctr-name> -- /bin/bash
```
## Task 3: Cleanup the resources using the below command
Delete the resources created during the lab:
```
kubectl delete -f mydep-empty.yaml
```
```
kubectl delete -f mydep-hp.yaml
```
